<b>My implementation of Storio Sample App</b><br>
Storio is SQLite-based database solution. It greatly reduces the amount of boilerplate that is required to deal with SQLite database. Since the official example is extremely heavy-weight, full of 3rd-party libraries and has some complicated gradle set up, I have created this clear small example, that:<br>
- Creates database<br>
- Shows some basic CRUD operations and queries<br>
<br>
This sample app unfortunately is not yet complete and has only one table in it's database.
