<b>My implementation of Storio Sample App</b><br>
<b>Storio</b> is SQLite-based database solution. Since the official example is extremely heavy-weight, full of 3rd-party libraries and has some complicated gradle set up, I have created this clear small example. For just some one who doesn't want like me to waste a whole evening at trying just to run the sample.
